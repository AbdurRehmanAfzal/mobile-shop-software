# 29 · Owner's pending list — server setup, commands, manual testing, decisions

For Abdur Rehman Afzal. Written 2026-11-01 because, as you said, nothing on your side has been done
yet: no manual testing, no environment variables on the server, no server commands. Everything
below is still **open**. Tick it here as you go (`[x]`), or tell Claude and it will update this file.

Older, more detailed notes stay valid: subscription reminders `docs/21-OWNER-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md`,
barcode scanner test `docs/23-BARCODES-PLAN.md`, accessories `docs/25`, tablets / watches `docs/27`,
provider console `docs/28`.

---

## A. On the server (VPS) — environment variables

File: `/opt/mobileshop/.env` (never commit it). After editing, restart the backend:

```
cd /opt/mobileshop
docker compose --env-file .env up -d backend
```

> Fixed 2026-11-01: `deploy/docker-compose.yml` did not pass most of these to the backend container,
> so setting them in `.env` had no effect (renewal keys could not be made on production at all).
> The fixed compose file reaches the server with the next deploy (`deploy.sh` downloads it).
> Do section A **after** that deploy.

| Done | Key | What it does | What to put |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | `SUPERUSER_PHONES` | your super-admin login number(s) | e.g. `03001234567` (check it is already there) |
| [ ] | `ADMIN_WHATSAPP` | you get "fee proof submitted" and "new shop request" messages | your WhatsApp number; empty = first `SUPERUSER_PHONES` |
| [ ] | `RENEWAL_PRIVATE_KEY` | signs license / renewal keys (Business → Keys) | from the keygen command in section B; **only on this server** |
| [ ] | `RENEWAL_PUBLIC_KEY` | checks keys (cloud and every one-PC install) | same keygen output |
| [ ] | `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID`, `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATES` | automatic WhatsApp (reminders, night report, OTP) | from Meta Business (docs/12); empty = messages are sent by hand |
| [ ] | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM` | emails | Gmail: `smtp.gmail.com`, `587`, an app password |
| [ ] | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | the assistant and photo reading (CNIC / box label) | your Claude API key; empty = "not switched on" |
| [ ] | `AI_DAILY_LIMIT` | calls per shop per day | `200` (default) |
| [ ] | `RCLONE_REMOTE` | off-server copy of the nightly backup | e.g. an encrypted Google Drive remote |
| [ ] | `SIGNUP_OTP` / `OTP_DEV_ECHO` | phone code at signup / test echo | `false` / **always `false` on production** |

## B. On the server — commands still to run

```
cd /opt/mobileshop

# 1. a production key pair for license / renewal keys (once). Paste both printed lines into .env,
#    then restart the backend (section A).
docker compose --env-file .env exec backend python -m app.modules.plan.renewal keygen

# 2. barcodes for stock entered before barcodes existed (once; safe to run again)
docker compose --env-file .env exec backend python -m app.modules.barcodes.backfill

# 3. check the database is on the latest version (migrations run by themselves when the backend
#    starts; this only confirms it). Expected: a5c7e9b1d3f6 (head)
docker compose --env-file .env exec backend alembic current
```

| Done | Command | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [ ] | keygen (1) | without it Business → Keys and "Renewal code" fail with "RENEWAL_PRIVATE_KEY is not set" |
| [ ] | barcode backfill (2) | old phones and items get a barcode; the button Settings → Barcode settings → "Barcodes for old stock" does the same per shop |
| [ ] | `alembic current` (3) | confirms migrations through `a5c7e9b1d3f6` (barcodes, accessories, tablets / watches, provider console, business profile, len-den, len-den return dates, repair labs) |

Not needed any more: running `alembic upgrade head` by hand (the backend image does it on start);
the accessories "Opening stock" batches (made by the migration).

## C. In the app — settings only you can fill

| Done | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| [ ] | Super admin → Fees card → **Billing settings** | bank name, account title, account number, IBAN, branch, support phone / WhatsApp; until then shopkeepers do not see payment details |
| [ ] | Super admin → Fees card → **Payment accounts** | Easypaisa / JazzCash / SadaPay numbers |
| [ ] | Billing settings → schedule | grace days after expiry: 7 now (decide, section E) |
| [ ] | Super admin → each shop | package, monthly fee, paid-until date |
| [ ] | Business → Shops → a shop → "Where it runs" | mark one-PC customers as Offline |
| [ ] | your own shop → Settings → Logo & business details / Tax registration / Currency | logo, NTN, how money is written |
| [ ] | your own shop → Settings → Barcode settings | prefix and barcode type, test print |
| [ ] | Settings → Item settings / Device settings | valuation (average / FIFO), negative stock, units; lock check for used mobiles |
| [ ] | every shop that printed stickers since 2026-10-31 | **reprint them** — those stickers were cut and do not scan (fixed 2026-11-01) |

## D. Manual testing (nothing tested by you yet)

**Demo shop with sample data in every module** (2026-11-02): `cd frontend && node scripts/demo-shop.mjs`
with the backend running. Locally it made "Demo Mobile Centre": owner `03001112233`, manager
`03221112233`, salesman `03331112233`, password `demo12345` — about two months of purchases
(cash / credit), sales (cash, udhaar, part paid, discount, tax, installments, wholesale, Easypaisa,
bank), returns both ways, a void, a price change, ID checks (pending / flagged / skipped with a
reason), tablet, watch, accessories by the dozen, a loan to another shop, repairs, bank deposit,
supplier payments, expenses. For the live server: `API=https://<domain>/api/v1 PHONE=03xxxxxxxxx
node scripts/demo-shop.mjs` — only if you want a demo shop on production.

Close the app fully and open it again first (or install the newest APK from the latest Deploy run →
`android / apk`), so the newest version loads.

|---|---|---|---|

| [ ] | Repair labs | Repairs → Repair labs → Add a lab (name, mobile, market); a repair job → Send to a lab → Back from lab (charge, paid now) | the lab's record shows the phone, fixed %, what you owe; Audit → Repairs shows income, lab charges, profit |

## E. Decisions waiting for you

| Done | Question | Now |
|---|---|---|
| [ ] | Grace days after plan end: 7 or 15? | 7 |
| [ ] | Freight on a purchase: owed to the supplier (on his bill) or a separate expense? | on the supplier's bill |
| [ ] | Per-item GST on the invoice? | item rate is stored, the bill uses the shop's tax rate |
| [ ] | Lock check also for used **mobiles**? | off (tablets / watches always) |
| [ ] | Tablet / watch page money card still says "Money on this phone" — change to "this device"? | not changed |
| [ ] | One-PC installs: give each the `SAAS_URL=https://<your domain>` line so they report to Business | not set |
| [x] | Item GST %: should a sale bill use the item's own rate? | **yes (owner 2026-11-03)**: when the bill is taxed, an item with its own GST % is taxed at it; others take the bill's rate; untaxed bills stay untaxed; the bill prints "Tax (by item)" |
| [x] | Purchase form: rename "Supplier invoice no." to "Reference / slip no."? | **yes (owner 2026-11-03)**: renamed in en / ur / roman |
| [x] | Super admin → password request from a staff member: change the requester's password? | **yes (owner 2026-11-03)**: opened from a request, "Set password" shows and changes that person's password; "Set the owner's instead" switches back |
